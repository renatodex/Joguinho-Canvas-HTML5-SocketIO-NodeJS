# Introduction

This is a prototype of a single game build with pure Canvas and Sockets.
In my last attempts, i tried to use Melon, Crafty and other game frameworks built in Javascript.
However, i really wanted to see how difficult it was to simulate the same idea using pure Canvas rendering system.

Now the idea is growing.
Im not sure it this sample is 100% fully functional, but im working on it right now.

# Problems

1) I have not implemented the moving listener yet, its a full listener, requiring both server and client i/o iteration.
But i think it gonna be easy..

# Notes

This is just an example with learning purposes, any help with improvments is apreciated too.
